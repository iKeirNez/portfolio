              <p>
                Worked on mostly backend server solutions for one of the largest Minecraft multiplayer networks, these solutions occasionally
                had to be capable of communicating across multiple server instances (accomplished using Redis). I spent most
                of my time there working on non-games/player lobby features. I also had to design and implement a backend
                database structure and create PHP scripts to dynamically generate web pages to fetch, process and display
                data from said database.

              <p>
                Worked as lead developer of a highly ambitious project to allow massive amounts of players to host their own Minecraft worlds
                and invite their friends to join them in their world. The backend servers were designed to be infinitely
                scalable by using multiple Google Compute instances to distribute the load, these would dynamically scale
                up or down depending on server traffic. This allowed the system to be effectively limitless.
